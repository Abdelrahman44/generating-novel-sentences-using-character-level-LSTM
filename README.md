# generating-novel-sentences-using-character-level-LSTM


Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks are used for processing and generating sequence data. LSTMs are used instead of RNNs to overcome the problem of exploding and vanishing gradients along with long-remebering of important information from the input sequences instead of remebering just the last input.
I this project, an LSTM network is constructed and trained to generate sequence characters. The network is not aware of the context and it is hard to generate meaningful entences as it is a character-level network, but meaningul words can be generated
